Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
<details>
Adapter
</details>








Decouple an abstraction from an implementation so the two can vary independently






Bridge






Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies





Composite




Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically




Decorator





Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem





Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently



Flyweight




Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it



Proxy



X is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.



Adapter



is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.



Bridge













 is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
 
 
 
 Composite
 
 

 is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
